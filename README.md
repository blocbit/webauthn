# PHP webauthn implementation

[webauthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) allows for browser logins
using a physical key (such as a [Yubikey 2 security
key](https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/)) or, in
due course, biometrics such as fingerprints, that support the
protocol. [Google announced a pair of compatible hardware keys recently
too](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-made-the-titan-key-to-toughen-up-your-online-security/),
but I don't have one yet to test code this with (6 Nov 2018: on order).

Webauthn was [announced for Firefox
60](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/05/09/firefox-gets-down-to-business-and-its-personal/)
in May 2018 and also later added to Chrome. The idea of the age of
password-less logins was widely broadcast in the technical press. But
the reality is the whole thing is just too complicated for easy
adoption. It needs another layer to simplify it for routine use.

There are a couple examples in Javascript (see the
["coffee" example](https://webauthn.bin.coffee/)). But the whole point is that the
challenge and authentication must be done server-side.

It's fiendishly complicated, not so much in the cryptography as the
way the structures are packed and named. Unnecessarily so
([CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)? What? Surely browsers
could have unpacked it from that even if space is at such a premium
that keys themselves require this weird binary format; and why not
produce the key in PEM format. And so on).

So I spent quite a while translating the "coffee" example into a PHP
class, while doing the minimum at the browser side (just unpacking
enough to put into a convenient JSON form to transport to the server),
and I thought I would share it.

## Dependencies

This requires

* [PHP CBOR library](https://github.com/2tvenom/CBOREncode)
* A recent openssl included in PHP ([openssl_verify](http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php)
in particular)

## Example

The example code is live at [https://webauthn.savesnine.info](https://webauthn.savesnine.info).
